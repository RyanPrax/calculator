The same x and y floats from before will be used, along with the header `<cmath>`

## Exponentials

For exponentials, the `pow()` function is used

```
    cout << "Enter A Number: ";
		cin >> x;
		cout << "Enter A Exponent: ";
		cin >> y;
		cout << x << " to the power of " << y << " is " << pow(x, y) << endl;
		system("pause");
		SelectionScreen();
```

## Square Roots

To calculate a square root in C++, the `sqrt()` function is used

```
    cout << "What Do You Want The Square Root of? \n";
		cin >> x;
		cout << "The square root of " << x << " is " << sqrt(x) << endl;
		system("pause");
		SelectionScreen();
```

## Cube Roots

To calculate a cube root in C++, the `cbrt()` function is used:

```
		cout << "What Do You Want The Cube Root of? \n";
		cin >> x;
		cout << "The cube root of " << x << " is " << cbrt(x) << endl;
		system("pause");
		SelectionScreen();
```
